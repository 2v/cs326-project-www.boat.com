## Data Interactions
1. The user can input as many genres and styles as necessary using a select box. Genres are more broad descriptions of the music while there are hundreds of styles that can optionally be added.
2. The user can connect their spotify account which will provide information about common musical styles that the user listens to.
3. The application will check the "Hot Releases" section of discogs filtered by genre and styles to determine possible albums.
4. The application will check new releases on BandCamp again filtered by genre.
5. The user can enter artists to specifically exclude so that no albums with that artist will be shown
- NOTE: from the combined BandCamp and Discogs albums, depulicated will be removed and a random selection of 8 albums will be chosen to display to the user. This will provide variety if they choose to generate new albums
